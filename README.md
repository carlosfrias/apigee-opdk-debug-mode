# Apigee OPDK Debug Mode

This role will update all of the bash scripts installed for Apigee components so that they 
execute with debug flags set. This causes bash scripts to output large amounts of content 
that is helpful in debugging an issue

Requirements
------------

Assumption that this is running on an node containing Apigee components. 

Role Variables
--------------

| Variable Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| opdk_debug_mode | 'on' or 'off' | When variable is set then debugging is enabled on all scripts. When the variable is set to 'off' debugging is disabled on all scripts |
| apigee_home | /opt/apigee | The variable containing the Apigee installation home |
| component_name | { name of apigee component } | If provided then only the bashs scripts fo the component will have their debug set to on or off. If not provided then the scripts for all components on the node will be set. |
| bash_regex | #.*bash | The line examined in every script that indicates whether the file is a bash script |

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: apigee-opdk-debug-mode, opdk_debug_mode: 'on' }
         
OR
    - hosts: servers
      vars: 
        opdk_debug_mode: 'on'
      roles:
      - { role: apigee-opdk-debug-mode }
